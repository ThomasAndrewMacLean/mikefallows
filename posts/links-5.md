Worthy of note.

[Wonky, an audio story by Michelle McGhee](https://pudding.cool/2023/06/groove/)
It's always great to find truly interactive content that takes full advantage of being on the web. As a huge fan of Dilla and someone that has next to no musical education, I found this a wonderful explanation of why his music hits differently.

[CSS HD Gradients](https://gradient.style/)
Killer tool to let you build out high definition gradients leveraging the `oklch` colour scheme. Anyone who remembers working on optimising GIFs and battling 'strobing' effects in certain gradient colour combinations, will appreciate that `oklch` provides much more natural (to the human eye) gradation points between colours.

[Don't Compare Averages](https://martinfowler.com/articles/dont-compare-averages.html)
Great article by Martin Fowler detailing the flaw in the (often tempting) method of comparing sets of averages, and how misleading the results can be.

[Alan Braxe in studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_GsiAf2qj8)
As someone who's musical awakening came at the height of French House this is a fascinating glimpse of how those tracks were made and how much the style was defined by the technology they were using. A reminder that cruder tools can be limiting, but are often more fun to play with! The impact of personal computers on DIY music soon ushered in almost unlimited abilities to create and source sounds, but so often the friction and imeadiacy inspires much greater creativity in some.

[Midjouney takes on Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/midjourney-sol-lewitt)
I remember being fascinated by the concept of LeWitt's wall drawing instructions and years ago having a conversation with a technician that installed a LeWitt at a gallery in Manchester. There's something really interesting in the boundaries established in the instructions that allow a little bit of personal interpretation so that the outcome isn't entirely predictable, but you can still see all the drawings as both the same and entirely unique. A great task for an AI prompt. Also, lol at it utterly refusing to draw wavy vertical lines.

[Subscribe Wherever You Get Your Podcasts](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/subscribe-wherever-you-get-your-content/)
Great observation on how podcasts have delivered on the principle of an open web, and maybe how else that can be expanded to other aspects of the online experience.
