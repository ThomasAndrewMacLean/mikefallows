Interesting bits from around the web.

[Visit for a surprise](https://ericwbailey.website/published/visit-for-a-surprise/ "An article about accessible link titles"). A great example of thinking deeply about the nuances involved in ensuring the web is accessible to as many people as possible without just ticking "accessibility" checkboxes. Context is key.

[AARRR](https://baremetrics.com/blog/aarrr-metrics-framework-what-is-it-and-how-to-use-it). A nice pirate-y acronym to help you remember "acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue". I find this useful when looking at a client's site and other touch-points to try and find opportunities to leverage improvements. You can be certain that there's always one point that can benefit from more attention.

[Before YouTube's algorithm there were "coolhunters"](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/09/youtube-homepage-editor-google-algorithm-book-excerpt/671339/). An article in _The Atlantic_ about the way the YouTube homepage was curated by hand. Plenty 

[How YouTube killed IE6](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/4/18529381/google-youtube-internet-explorer-6-kill-plot-engineer). I was reminded of this article in _The Verge_ about the actions of a small group of engineers at YouTube in the early days that helped accelerate the demise of Internet Explorer 6, and I don't blame them one bit. Bonus, there's a picture of a client in the screen grab of YouTube's homepage. There's also a Twitter thread somewhere that I can't find for the life of me, but was an interesting tale of Pinterest's human curated homepage in the early days. 

[AI is not the problem](https://www.stilldrinking.org/ai-is-not-the-problem). Obviously, it's _the_ hot topic, and there's plenty of opinions around, but this one struck a chord. I recently listened to the [2021 Reith Lectures on the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001216k/episodes/player) which had some interesting discussion around the ethics of AI from a time before ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion become part of the discourse.
