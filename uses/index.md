For posterity, a rundown of my setup and the current apps that I use in 2021.

### Hardware

My main work machine is a Mac Mini with an M1 chip which I use with a 5K LG display. I also have an older 15" Mac Book Pro with an Intel chip I can take with me. I use [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) and a dotfiles repo to keep my dev setup in sync.

### Editor

I still have a copy of Panic's Coda knocking around on an old machine for some legacy projects, but these days I almost exclusively use VS Code. The ability to customise it is extremely valuable to me because I work across a range of languages, and I got huge value from Caleb Porzio's [Make VS Code Awesome](https://makevscodeawesome.com/) package. That gives me a really elegant setup with very few changes required.

I use the [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font with custom ligatures set.

### Terminal

I tend to use VS Code's integrated terminal most often, but for tasks not related to a specific project I use [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/) with the Z Shell and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) with the [Sorin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes#sorin) theme. I use Fira Code here too.

### Git

Most of my project's code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and I use the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app for most tasks as it's still much quicker and less error-prone for me to switch between projects and make commits than on the command line.

### Adobe

I use [Adobe](https://adobe.com/) CS for the bulk of my design work. InDesign and Photoshop for print work, and XD for generating web graphics. Occasionally I use After Effects for some motion graphics.

### Codekit

[Codekit](https://codekitapp.com/) has some great features for processing files and setting up a local server through a GUI. It has allowed me to set up project workflows very quickly regardless of the stack.
